Contributing to  NICOS
======================

Thanks for wanting to contribute to NICOS.

While we offer a mirror of the code on https://github.com/mlz-ictrl/nicos,
our primary repository is our Gerrit Code Review server at
https://forge.frm2.tum.de/review/q/status:open+project:frm2/nicos/nicos.

We will discuss and accept pull requests for small changes on GitHub,
but for larger-scale changes we ask that you contact us to get access to
the Gerrit Code Review system, where it is much easier for us to keep
track of such work.
