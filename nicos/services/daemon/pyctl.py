    """
    The Controller object allows to execute Python code in a controlled
    environment using the Python tracing mechanism (using a C trace function
    instead of a Python one for speed).

    The running code can therefore be halted and stopped from another thread.
    Additionally, the currently executed line and Python frame can be observed.

    Halting works by calling a custom function ("break function") from the trace
    function -- until this function returns the execution is halted.

    Stopping works by throwing an exception from the trace function into the
    frame executing code, where it should be allowed to propagate to the
    toplevel and exit excecution.  The exception (ControlStop) inherits from
    BaseException.  This works nicely together with "finally:" clauses, but
    requires that bare "except:" clauses are replaced by "except Exception:".

    There are various options to control breaking behavior.  By default, a break
    can occur everywhere.  "break_only_in_toplevel" limits breaking so that a
    break can only occur between two lines of code in the toplevel code.
    "break_only_in_filename" works similar, but if it is set, breaks can occur
    in all frames whose code has the given filename.  Using this, breakpoints in
    non-toplevel code are implemented.

    Using an "observer" callable, changes in the line number and execution need
    not be polled: each time the status or line number changes, the observer is
    called as observer(status, lineno).

    The external interface is usually used like this:

    In the executing thread:
    * instantiate the Controller object
    * call set_observer() to add an observer
    * call start()/start_exec()

    In the controlling thread:
    * when halting is wanted, call set_break()
    * when continuing is wanted, call set_continue()
    * when stopping is wanted, call set_stop()

    Signature of the C class:

    Controller(breakfunc,                     # break function
               break_only_in_toplevel=False,  # see above
               break_only_in_filename=None,   # see above
               lineno_behavior)               # which line numbers to trace

    Methods of the C class:

    - start(callable): start execution, calling the given callable as toplevel
    - start_exec(code, globals[, locals]): start execution of the given code
      object with the global and local scopes
    - set_break(arg): request a break, the breakfunc will be called at the
      next trace function run, the arg is given to the breakfunc; a not-None
      arg is supposed to mean "stop"
    - set_stop(arg): request a stop, the arg will be used as an intializer
      argument to the ControlStop exception
    - set_observer(observer): attach an observer to the instance

    Attributes of the C class:

    - status: execution status
    - currentframe: current execution frame
    - toplevelframe: first and topmost execution frame
    - lineno: current line number (in which frame, see lineno_behavior)
